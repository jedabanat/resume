I am an experienced software engineer proficient in building and maintaining Windows desktop applications in C\# with a strong understanding of designing \& implementing signal processing algorithms. Iâ€™ve worked autonomously as a sole developer for most of my career, leading development initiatives from conception to global deployment. I actively question the requirements and collaborate cross-functionally to ensure the best solution is developed. As a passionate advocate for automation, I strive to streamline processes within both the development workflow and the product itself.

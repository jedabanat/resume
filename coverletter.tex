Dear Hiring Manager, \\

I am writing to express my interest in the [Position] role at [Company]. As a software engineer with more than five years of experience in developing and maintaining complex C\# applications, I am confident that I can bring significant value to the team. \\

Throughout my career at Fugro, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to independently manage and deliver high-quality and innovative software solutions. As the tech lead responsible for a lidar data processing solution (\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f65bdm4tous}{\underline{Fugro RAMMS}}), I have worked throughout the entire software development life cycle process from conceptualising and implementing prototypes, to comprehensive testing and deployment at a global scale. \\

I have extensive experience with C\# (.NET Framework \& Core) with a strong background in designing signal processing algorithms and development of several Windows desktop applications in WPF. I actively worked with end-users to gather and understand their requirements and interpret the designs into a maintainable, highly testable, and robust applications that met the delivery timelines. As my domain knowledge grew, I was able to critically analyse and question proposed features to determine the actual need, and therefore select and create the most effective and efficient solutions. I am a strong advocate of developing reusable components and avoiding “reinventing the wheel” if there is a existing solution available. \\

I grew up in Indonesia, following a home-schooling program until the age of 14 when I moved to Australia to complete my education. This fostered a strong sense of curiosity and initiative which were instrumental to my success at Fugro and led to the company sponsoring my relocation to Houston, Texas in 2019. I embraced a diverse range of responsibilities including acting as Agile Product Owner, developing data processing workflows, defining roadmaps, and providing ongoing support to the Operations team. I enjoyed this dynamic environment as juggling multiple responsibilities gave me a fuller perspective to contribute and shape the architecture of the product. \\

I’m drawn to this role at [Company] because... I am excited to bring my skills and ideas to the team and work on meaningful projects.  Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing this opportunity further. \\

Sincerely,\\
Jed Abanat

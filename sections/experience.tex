    {Houston, TX, USA}
    {Innovation (Software) Engineer}
    {Sep 2019 - July 2023}

\workExperienceSubItem{
    \item Technical lead of a desktop software suite which processed airborne lidar bathymetry data. Wrote 70\% of the code and reviewed the remaining 30\%. Responsible for a team of 3 developers.
    \item \justifying{Architected and implemented a high-performance data processing pipeline using TPL Dataflow with a multi-threaded, event-driven approach achieving an 80\% reduction in processing time.}
    \item Designed user interfaces in WPF using MVVM, working with end-users to achieve an intuitive user experience. The UI displayed the raw data along with interactive charts and graphs to assist data processors during QC/QA.
    \item Built 2 additional WPF apps to support field staff; an automatic data transfer tool to copy raw data (2TB/flight) \& a QC tool to generate georeferenced images collected during the flight.
    \item \justifying{Developed a novel bathymetric lidar processing solution with the ML team which replaced traditional signal processing algorithms with an image recognition approach. Resulted in 95\% less noise \& improved accuracy of final product by 30\%. Filed a patent for this invention.}
    \item \justifying{Effectively served as Agile Product Owner for 18 months, working with stakeholders to gather \& clarify requirements, prioritise deliverables, manage OKRs, \& define development roadmaps, ensuring alignment with business objectives.}
    \item Collaborated with architects to refactor and optimise legacy C\# code during a rotation with other teams. Wrote a new low latency codec for a separate real-time Windows desktop application.
    \item Implemented CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions to automate build \& testing, reducing release time by 2 hours.
    \item \justifying{Contributed to a company-wide initiative to develop standardised Visual Studio .NET project configuration templates, improving developer experience and ensuring consistency across across all (50+) .NET repos.}
    \item Led code reviews and on-boarding programs to mentor colleagues, providing technical guidance and demonstrating best-practices. Presented at internal \textit{`Innovators Conference`} in 2020 \& 2022.

\workExperienceItem
    {Fugro Australia Marine}
    {Adelaide, Australia}
    {Airborne Software Engineer}
    {March 2018 - Sep 2019}

\workExperienceSubItem{
    \item Maintained and improved an acquired MATLAB code-base as the sole developer, working autonomously to fix bugs and add additional features requested by data processors.
    \item Led fortnightly planning and demo meetings with global stakeholders to ensure alignment on key priorities and to collect feedback on new features \& bug fixes.
    \item Wrote Python scripts to produce ancillary Hydrographic data products, generating an additional \$8k per survey job.
    \item Researched, tested and developed signal processing \& noise filtering algorithms to improve peak detection accuracy.
    \item Travelled to Houston regularly to meet directly with end-users and external clients to gather requirements and collect app feedback. Provided hands-on field support and gained additional context to proactively identify and address bottlenecks (data storage management \& automating manual processes) in the processing workflow.

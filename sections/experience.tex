    {Innovation (Software) Engineer}
    {Sep 2019 - July 2023}

\workExperienceSubItem{
    \item Technical lead of a software suite which processed airborne lidar bathymetry data. Wrote 70\% of the code and reviewed the remaining 30\%. 
    \item \begin{justify}Developed a novel bathymetric lidar processing solution with the ML team which replaced traditional signal processing algorithms with an image recognition approach. Resulted in 95\% less noise \& improved accuracy of final product by 30\%. Filed a patent for this invention - \textit{‘Machine Learning Processing of Airborne Lidar Bathymetric Waveform Data’} \end{justify}
    \item Migrated original MATLAB processing app into a .NET console app in C\#, following SOLID design principles \& implementing Test-Driven Development practices. Increased test coverage from 0\% to 65\%.
    \item Architected and implemented a high-performance data processing pipeline using TPL Dataflow with a multi-process, event-driven approach achieving an 80\% reduction in processing time.
    \item Designed user interfaces in WPF using MVVM, displaying raw data with overlaid plots and graphs.
    \item Effectively served as Agile Product Owner for 18 months, actively engaging with end-users to gather requirements, prioritise deliverables, and define the development roadmap, ensuring alignment with business objectives. 
    \item Built 2 additional .NET apps to support field staff; an automatic data transfer tool to copy raw data (2TB/flight) \& a QC tool to generate georeferenced images collected during the flight.
    \item Implemented CI/CD workflows in GitHub Actions, reducing release time by 2 hours.
    \item Contributed to Visual Studio .NET project configuration templates to standardise all .NET repos in the company.
    \item \justifying{Led on-boarding programs and mentored colleagues, providing technical guidance and demonstrating best-practices.}

    {Fugro Australia Marine}
    {Adelaide, Australia}
    {Airborne Software Engineer}
    {March 2018 - Sep 2019}

\workExperienceSubItem{
    \item Maintained and improved an acquired MATLAB code-base as the sole developer, working autonomously to fix bugs and add additional features requested by data processors.
    \item Led fortnightly planning and demo meetings with global stakeholders to ensure alignment on key priorities and to collect feedback on new features \& bug fixes.
    \item Wrote Python scripts to produce ancillary Hydrographic data products, generating an additional \$8k per survey job.
    \item Researched, tested and developed signal processing \& noise filtering algorithms to improve peak detection accuracy.
    \item Travelled to Houston regularly to meet directly with end-users and external clients to gather requirements and collect app feedback. Provided hands-on field support and gained additional context to proactively identify and address bottlenecks (such as data storage management \& automating manual processes) in the processing workflow.
    \item Automated the deployment of the MATLAB code using Ruby scripts to compile and generate an installer.

{\emph{Engineering Intern}}
{\emph{Jan 2018 - Mar 2018}} \\

\workExperienceSubItem{
    \item Independently conducted thorough analysis of an acquired code-base in MATLAB (\textasciitilde 8000 lines) to identify and understand each component and function of the process.
    \item Produced comprehensive technical documentation and detailed flowchart diagrams explaining the code to global stakeholders, resulting in improved cross-functional collaboration between the Adelaide \& Houston offices.

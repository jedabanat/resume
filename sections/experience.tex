    {Houston, TX, USA}
    {Innovation (Software) Engineer}
    {Sep 2019 - July 2023}

\workExperienceSubItem{
    \item Technical lead of a software suite which processed airborne lidar bathymetry data. Wrote 70\% of the code and reviewed the remaining 30\%. 
    \item Architected and implemented a high-performance data processing pipeline using TPL Dataflow with a multi-process, event-driven approach achieving an 80\% reduction in processing time.
    \item Designed user interfaces in WPF using MVVM, working with end-users to achieve an intuitive user experience. The UI displayed the raw data along with interactive charts and graphs to assist data processors during QC/QA.
    \item Built 2 additional WPF apps to support field staff; an automatic data transfer tool to copy raw data (2TB/flight) \& a QC tool to generate georeferenced images collected during the flight.
    \item \begin{justify}Developed a novel bathymetric lidar processing solution with the ML team which replaced traditional signal processing algorithms with an image recognition approach. Resulted in 95\% less noise \& improved accuracy of final product by 30\%. Filed a patent for this invention - \textit{‘Machine Learning Processing of Airborne Lidar Bathymetric Waveform Data’} \end{justify}
    \item Effectively served as Agile Product Owner for 18 months, actively engaging with stakeholders to gather requirements, prioritise deliverables, and define the development roadmap, ensuring alignment with business objectives. 
    \item Implemented CI/CD workflows in GitHub Actions, reducing release time by 2 hours.
    \item Contributed to Visual Studio .NET project configuration templates to standardise all .NET repos in the company.
    \item Led on-boarding programs and mentored colleagues, providing technical guidance and demonstrating best-practices.

    {Fugro Australia Marine}
    {Adelaide, Australia}
    {Airborne Software Engineer}
    {March 2018 - Sep 2019}

\workExperienceSubItem{
    \item Maintained and improved an acquired MATLAB code-base as the sole developer, working autonomously to fix bugs and add additional features requested by data processors.
    \item Researched, tested and implemented signal processing \& noise filtering algorithms to meet client requirements. 
    \item Travelled to Houston regularly to meet directly with end-users and external clients to gather requirements and collect app feedback. Provided hands-on field support and gained additional context to proactively identify \& address bottlenecks in the processing workflow.
    \item Led fortnightly planning and demo meetings with end-users to ensure alignment on key priorities and to collect feedback on new features \& bug fixes, resulting in improved user satisfaction.
    \item Automated the deployment of the MATLAB code using Ruby scripts to compile and generate an installer.

{\emph{Engineering Intern}}
{\emph{Jan 2018 - Mar 2018}} \\

\workExperienceSubItem{
    \item Independently conducted thorough analysis of an acquired code-base in MATLAB (\textasciitilde 8000 lines) to identify and understand each component and function of the process.
    \item Produced comprehensive technical documentation and detailed flowchart diagrams explaining the code to global stakeholders, resulting in improved cross-functional collaboration between the Adelaide \& Houston offices.
    \item Built a UI for the code using MATLAB GUIDE, working with users to design an intuitive \& interactive tool.

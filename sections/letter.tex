Dear Hiring Manager, \\

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer - C\# .NET WPF role at Nine Mile. As a software engineer with more than five years of experience in developing and maintaining sophisticated desktop applications, I am confident that I can bring significant value to the team. \\

Throughout my career at Fugro, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to independently manage and deliver high-quality and innovative software solutions. As the tech lead responsible for a lidar data processing solution (\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f65bdm4tous}{\underline{Fugro RAMMS}}), I have worked throughout the entire software development life cycle process from conceptualising and implementing prototypes, to comprehensive testing and deployment at a global scale. \\

I have extensive experience with C\# (.NET Core \& Framework) and have developed several WPF applications. I actively worked with end-users and global stakeholders to gather and understand their requirements, to then define the system's functionality and write a maintainable, highly testable, and robust application. As my domain knowledge grew, I was able to critically analyse and question proposed features to determine the actual need, and therefore the most effective solutions. I am a strong advocate of developing reusable components and avoiding “reinventing the wheel” if there is a existing solution
available. \\

One of the WPF apps I built displayed high-resolution images of raw data, along with several interactive charts and graphs that allowed users to visualise the waveforms and validate the processed data. During a rotation with a separate team, I worked on rendering the precise representation of an underwater vehicle (AUV). The accuracy of the rendering was critical as surveyors relied on the tool to ensure the AUV's safe operation and avoid collisions with the seafloor. \\

I grew up in Indonesia, following a home-schooling program until the age of 14 when I moved to Australia to complete my education. This fostered a strong sense of curiosity and initiative which were instrumental to my success at Fugro and led to the company sponsoring my relocation to Houston, Texas in 2019. I embraced a diverse range of responsibilities including acting as Agile Product Owner, developing data processing workflows, assessing \& managing risks, defining roadmaps, and providing ongoing support to the Operations team. I enjoyed this dynamic environment as juggling multiple responsibilities gave me a fuller perspective to contribute and shape the development of the product. \\

Nine Mile's commitment to innovation and emphasis placed on collaboration, ownership and growth, strongly aligns with my own values and I'm excited to contribute to your mission of being a leading global market maker. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing this opportunity further. \\

Sincerely,\\
Jed Abanat

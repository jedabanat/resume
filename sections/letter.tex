Dear Hiring Manager, \\

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Software Engineer - Productive Engineering Team role at Octopus Deploy. As a software engineer with more than five years of experience in developing and maintaining complex C\# applications, I am confident that I can bring significant value to the team. \\

At Fugro, I was the tech lead responsible for a lidar data processing solution (\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f65bdm4tous}{\underline{Fugro RAMMS}}). I worked on this project through the entire software development life cycle, from the research and development of low-level signal processing algorithms, to the architecture of the high-performance data processing pipeline, comprehensive testing, and global deployment and maintainance of the application. I also simultaneously acted as Agile Product Owner for 18 months, working closely with end-users to gather \& refine requirements, defining development roadmaps, managing OKRs, and providing hands-on support to the Survey team. I enjoyed this dynamic environment as juggling multiple responsibilities gave me a fuller perspective to contribute and shape the architecture of the product. \\

I have extensive experience with C\# (.NET Core \& Framework) and have developed several console and GUI applications, working closely with end-users and global stakeholders to gather and understand their requirements, define the system's functionality and write a maintainable, highly testable, and robust application. As my domain knowledge grew, I was able to critically analyse and question proposed features to determine the actual need, and therefore the most effective solutions. \\

During a "magic-time" project, I contributed to building Visual Studio .NET project configuration templates to promote reusable components and ensure consistency across all (50+) .NET repos. I'm passionate about automation and the user experience, and strive to streamline processes within the development workflow and the product itself. \\

I grew up in Indonesia, following a home-schooling program until the age of 14 when I moved to Australia to complete my education. This fostered a strong sense of curiosity and initiative which were instrumental to my success at Fugro and led to the company sponsoring my relocation to Houston, Texas in 2019. I've since left Fugro to travel and relocate back to Australia, and I'm really excited about this role at Octopus Deploy because of the emphasis placed on automation and the recognition of "elusive success" when working with customers to help them succeed. Octopusâ€™s transparent ways of working resonates strongly with me, as does the balance of autonomous work and pairing with other engineers. I am excited to bring my skills and ideas to the team and work on meaningful projects. \\

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing this opportunity further. \\

Sincerely,\\
Jed Abanat

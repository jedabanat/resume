Dear Hiring Manager, \\

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Software Engineer (Fullstack) role at Neara. As a software engineer with more than five years of experience in developing and maintaining complex applications for LiDAR data processing, I am confident that I can bring significant value to your team. \\

At Fugro, I was the tech lead responsible for a LiDAR data processing solution (\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f65bdm4tous}{\underline{Fugro RAMMS}}). I worked on this project through the entire software development life cycle, from the research and development of low-level signal processing algorithms, to the architecture of the high-performance data processing pipeline, comprehensive testing, and global deployment and maintenance of the application. \\

In collaboration with the Machine Learning team, I led the development of a new LiDAR data processing solution to eliminate the need for manual data cleaning of the output product, which led to Fugro being able to competitively bid for more projects. The existing MATLAB processing app used traditional signal processing algorithms and left a significant amount of noise points in the output product that required manual correction, making the process time-consuming and labour intensive. A proof-of-concept was developed, and once we demonstrated its feasibility, I began to plan the full-scale development. \\

I took on the role of Agile Product Owner for 18 months, working directly with the end-users of the application to determine the requirements of the MVP and the delivery timeline. I was allocated three developers for the project and managed their onboarding while actively planning the sprints. One identified risk was that the PoC would only work for a specific set of data. I prioritised specific tasks to validate the ML model on diverse datasets, enabling us to “fail quickly” if necessary. I also worked with management to establish objectives and key results (OKRs) for the new development effort which included both business and development outcomes.  \\

I grew up in Indonesia, following a home-schooling program until the age of 14 when I moved to Australia to complete my education. This fostered a strong sense of curiosity and initiative which were instrumental to my success at Fugro and led to the company sponsoring my relocation to Houston, Texas in 2019. As the result of a personal decision to relocate back to Australia from the US, I left Fugro and am seeking my next career opportunity. \\

The opportunity to work at Neara really excites me due to the team-oriented culture and the ability to continue my development as a software engineer in a mathematically complex coding environment. I have loved working on LiDAR solutions because of the complexity of the problems and opportunities to innovate in ways that truly make a difference in the world, and am excited to apply that to the utilities industry via the digital twin platform. This line from the job description really resonated with me -  \textit{this is not an "on click button, send RPC" kind of application}, and gives me confidence that working for Neara would be really fulfilling.\\

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing this opportunity further. \\

Sincerely,\\
Jed Abanat

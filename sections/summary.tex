Software engineer with 5+ years of experience building and maintaining complex data processing applications. Iâ€™ve led development initiatives through the full development lifecycle from conception to global deployment, following an Agile framework to build fully functional solutions. As a developer who actively questions requirements and works with end-users to try to fully understand their problem before developing a purpose-built solution, the emphasis Qantas places on high-level thinking aligns strongly with me. I'm passionate about automation and strive to streamline processes within both the development workflow and the product itself. I'm excited by the opportunity to bring my skills \& experience to the team, learn a new programming language, and contribute to creating new and unique customer experiences with Qantas Hotels.

Software engineer with 5+ years experience proficient in building and maintaining desktop applications in C\# and designing intuitive user interfaces using WPF. Worked autonomously for most of my career, leading development initiatives from conception to global deployment. I actively question the requirements and collaborate cross-functionally to ensure the best solution is developed. As a passionate advocate for automation, I strive to streamline processes and improve the experience within both the development workflow and the product itself.

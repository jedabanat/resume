Software engineer with 5+ years of experience building and maintaining complex data processing applications. Working autonomously for most of my career, I've led development initiatives from conception to global deployment, engaging in discussions regarding business value and feature trade-offs. I actively question requirements and collaborate cross-functionally to try to fully understand the problem to develop a purpose-built solution. I'm passionate about automation and strive to streamline processes within both the development workflow and the product itself. I'm excited by the opportunity to bring my technical skills \& product experience to the Airtasker team, further empowering the connection between customers and Taskers.
